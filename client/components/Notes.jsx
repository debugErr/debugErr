import React from 'react';
import { Typography } from '@mui/material';

function Platform({ notes }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ border: '1px solid black', textAlign: 'center' }}>
      <Typography>Notes</Typography>
     I started on this, but it seems to have turned into a bigger issue..
    </div>
  );
}

export default Platform;
